These data are from a test composed 
of all Likert scale items that are scored from 0 to 3 points.                             
Likert items do not have distractors in the sense that there are wrong answers. 
The closer the item difficulty is to 3, the easier 
the item. You can see in the figure that item18 is the easiest item (2.5940) 
and item10 is the most difficult (1.1120). Dividing each of these values by the 
maximum possible item score puts item difficulty back onto a 0 to 1 scale, but the 
interpretation is different than it was for binary items. Item difficulty values for 
item18 and item10 become 0.8647 and 0.3707, respectively, when divided by 
the maximum possible item score. With this transformation it is easy to see that 
item18 is easier than item10.
With respect to item discrimination, the estimates range from 0.4971 to 0.6548 
and are clearly in the desired range. There is no indication of a problem with any 
of these items.
